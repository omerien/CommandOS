# CommandOS
[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/omerien/CommandOS.svg)](https://github.com/omerien/CommandOS/releases)

CommandOS is a command line OS in python. Feel free to upgrade it ! I will post the 1.0 this weekend.

To-do list :
* Finish the math command
* Do the date command
* Do a login command
* Do a settings command

PS: For the future, please put the file in a specific folder named "CommandOS", to allow the code to put his files not everywhere.
