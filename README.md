# CommandOS
CommandOS is a command line OS in python. Feel free to upgrade it ! I will post the 1.0 this weekend.

Implemented features :

* A language system (2 languages provided)
* An exit system (to exit the script)

To-do list :

PS: For the future, please put the file in a specific folder named "CommandOS", to allow the code to put his files.
