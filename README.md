# CommandOS
CommandOS is a command line OS in python. Feel free to upgrade it ! I will post the 1.0 when I'm gonna find the time for that.

To-do list :
* Finish the math command
* Do the date command
* Do a login command
* Do a settings command

PS: For the future, please put the file in a specific folder named "CommandOS", to allow the code to put his files not everywhere.
